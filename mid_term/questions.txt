Instructions for Mid-Term submission and Git Review (10pts):
 - Create a git repository for your answers
 - Add and Commit as you work through the questions and programming problems
 - Your git log should reflect your work, don't just commit after you have finished working
 - Use .gitignore to ignore any files that are not relevant to the midterm
 - E-mail me your ssh public key (Find at ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub)
 - I will email you back with your repository name
 - Add a remote to your git repository: git@nird.us:RubyFall2012/YOURREPOSITORYNAME.git
 - Push your changes to the remote
 - After 6pm Tuesday November 13th you will not be able to push to your remote repository (or clone).

 Questions (20pts):

----

Q1. What are the three uses of the curly brackets {} in Ruby?

1. Hash instantiation:

  hash1 = { :fish => "Wanda",
            :boy => "Sue",
            :streetcar => "Desire" }

  puts hash1

  {:fish=>"Wanda", :boy=>"Sue", :streetcar=>"Desire"}

2. Block delimiters, including creating Proc or lambda objects

  hash1.each { |k, v| puts "A #{k.to_s} named \"#{v.to_s}\"" }

  A fish named "Wanda"
  A boy named "Sue"
  A streetcar named "Desire"

  doubler = lambda { |p| puts "#{p}*2 = #{p*2}" }

  puts "Object doubler is of class #{doubler.class}"
  puts "doubler.inspect returns #{doubler.inspect}"

  Object doubler is of class Proc
  doubler.inspect returns #<Proc:0x00000001252d98@sample1.rb:15 (lambda)>

  doubler.call 10
  doubler.call "fish"
  doubler.call ["zz", "yy", "xx"]
  doubler.call [:a, :b]

  10*2 = 20
  fish*2 = fishfish
  ["zz", "yy", "xx"]*2 = ["zz", "yy", "xx", "zz", "yy", "xx"]
  [:a, :b]*2 = [:a, :b, :a, :b]

3. Code-evaluation within a double-quoted string.

  See the preceding examples, string output made use of this.

----

Q2. What is a regular expression and what is a common use for them?

----

Q3. What is the difference between how a String, a symbol, a FixNum, and a Float are stored in Ruby?

----

Q4. Are these two statements equivalent? Why or Why Not?
   1. x, y = "hello", "hello"
   2. x = y = "hello"
(Try this out, with object_id, but it looks like they will be different objects for parallel assignment, and the same object for the repeat assignment.)

----

Q5. What is the difference between a Range and an Array?

----

Q6. Why would I use a Hash instead of an Array?

----

Q7. What is your favorite thing about Ruby so far?
* Proc objects as a way of passing code are a useful idea.

----

Q8. What is your least favorite thing about Ruby so far?
* Since variables and method parameters aren't typed, and since there is no compile-time checking of parameters, the coder has to include boilerplate type-checking in every method to make sure the parameters passed are of the correct type.

 Programming Problems (10pts each):
 - Write a passing rspec file called even_number_spec.rb that tests a class called EvenNumber.
    - The EvenNumber class should:
       - Only allow even numbers
       - Get the next even number
       - Compare even numbers
       - Generate a range of even numbers
- Make the rspec tests in wish_list_spec.rb pass by writing a WishList class
   - The WishList class should:
      - Mixin Enumerable
      - Define each so it returns wishes as strings with their index as part of the string

====
 
Mid-Term Spec (50pts):
- Make the tests pass.
